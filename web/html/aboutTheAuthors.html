<p id="nameHeading">Maya Ryan</p>
<p id="info">
    <div>
         Maya Ryan was born in Melbourne, Australia on July 6, 2001.  She moved to the United States of America at the age of 4, after completing elementary and high school.  She enrolled in Harvard University at the
    age of 5 and graduated at the age of 8 with a Bachelor of Science.  Shortly after graduating college, Ryan travelled the world alone in a voyage of discovery.  Upon her return to the United
    States, Ryan adopted twelve cats, eight dogs, and a shark.<br/></div>
    <div>
         Despite obtaining a Bachelor of Science when she was 8, Ryan decided to go into writing.  She wrote three bestselling autobigraphies, for which she was awarded a Nobel Prize in Literature.  Although she was quite successful
    as an author, Ryan eventually left writing to join the Cirque du Soleil at the age of 10.  She made a living as a travelling trapeze artist, but her career ended when she fractured her tibial sesamoid.  Lost and
    heartbroken by this devastating injury, Ryan returned home to live with her parents at age 12.  <br/></div>
    <div>
         While living at home, Ryan enjoyed playing games on her mother's computer, but she often broke the computer, so her mother banned her from using the computer.  Ryan decided to buy her own computer with the funds
    she had saved up from her autobiographies and her time with Cirque du Soleil.  With this computer, she learned how to code in Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After only a year of living with her parents, Ryan went on
        the search for a new career. <br/></div>
    <div>
         Over the next few years, Ryan worked as a lunch lady, PE teacher, and a chemistry professor.  She continued to practice coding during this time, and eventually realized that she could get a job as a software
    engineer with her coding skills.  At 16 years old, Ryan stumbled upon a CDK Global advertisement one night as she stayed up late watching infomercials.  After learning that CDK Global was hiring, she applied for a job
        at CDK Global and was alerted that she got the job a couple of months later.  With a new chance, new knowledge, and a new hope, Ryan became determined to change the world as a software engineer.  <br/></div>
    <div>
         The Hangman game that you are about to play may appear to be a simple computer game on the surface, but at its root, it symbolizes what initially sparked Ryan's interest in software engineering: computer games.
    Ryan plans on changing the world one game at a time, one hung man at a time, and one line of code at the time.  She thanks you for supporting her on this journey by playing Hangman, and she hops you enjoy.</div>
